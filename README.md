# Alex Prototype
A prototype of a story-based game using the Unity OpenAI SDK. A combination of programmatic logic and API calls to different LLMs allows a custom story to be influenced by the player's choices. The focus is on providing the player with choices of how to develop psychologically, leading to endless brnaching narrative within specific constraints.
